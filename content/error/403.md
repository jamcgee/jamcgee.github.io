> ## 6.5.3.  403 Forbidden
>
> The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood
> the request but refuses to authorize it.  A server that wishes to
> make public why the request has been forbidden can describe that
> reason in the response payload (if any).
>
> If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the
> server considers them insufficient to grant access.  The client
> SHOULD NOT automatically repeat the request with the same
> credentials.  The client MAY repeat the request with new or different
> credentials.  However, a request might be forbidden for reasons
> unrelated to the credentials.
>
> An origin server that wishes to "hide" the current existence of a
> forbidden target resource MAY instead respond with a status code of
> 404 (Not Found).

> ## 403 Forbidden
>
> The request is forbidden because of some reason that remains
> unknown to the client. Authorization will not help and the request
> should not be repeated. This status code can be used if the server
> does not want to make public why the request cannot be fulfilled.
