> ## 6.5.4.  404 Not Found
>
> The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did
> not find a current representation for the target resource or is not
> willing to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not
> indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or
> permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the
> origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that
> the condition is likely to be permanent.
>
> A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
> indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
> [Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2)).

> ## 404 Not Found
>
> The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No
> indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or
> permanent. If the server does not wish to make this information
> available to the client, the status code "403 Forbidden" can be
> used instead. The "410 Gone" status code should be used if the
> server knows (through some internally configurable method) that an
> old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding
> address.
