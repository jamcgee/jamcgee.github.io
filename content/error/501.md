> ## 6.6.2.  501 Not Implemented
>
> The 501 (Not Implemented) status code indicates that the server does
> not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.  This
> is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the
> request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.
>
> A 501 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
> indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
> [Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2)).
