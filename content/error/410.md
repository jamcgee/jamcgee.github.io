> ## 6.5.9.  410 Gone
>
> The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target
> resource is no longer available at the origin server and that this
> condition is likely to be permanent.  If the origin server does not
> know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition
> is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) ought to be used
> instead.
>
> The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web
> maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is
> intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that
> remote links to that resource be removed.  Such an event is common
> for limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to
> individuals no longer associated with the origin server's site.  It
> is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as
> "gone" or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to
> the discretion of the server owner.
>
> A 410 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
> indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
> [Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2)).
