> ## 6.5.5.  405 Method Not Allowed
>
> The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method
> received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not
> supported by the target resource.  The origin server MUST generate an
> Allow header field in a 405 response containing a list of the target
> resource's currently supported methods.
>
> A 405 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
> indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
> [Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2)).
