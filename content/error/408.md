> ## 6.5.7.  408 Request Timeout
>
> The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did
> not receive a complete request message within the time that it was
> prepared to wait.  A server SHOULD send the "close" connection option
> ([Section 6.1 of [RFC7230]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.1))
> in the response, since 408 implies that
> the server has decided to close the connection rather than continue
> waiting.  If the client has an outstanding request in transit, the
> client MAY repeat that request on a new connection.
