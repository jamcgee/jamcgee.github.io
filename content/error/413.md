> ## 6.5.11.  413 Payload Too Large
>
> The 413 (Payload Too Large) status code indicates that the server is
> refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger
> than the server is willing or able to process.  The server MAY close
> the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.
>
> If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a
> Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after
> what time the client MAY try again.

> ## 413 Request Entity Too Large
>
> The server is refusing to process a request because it considers the
> request entity to be larger than it is willing or able to process. The
> server SHOULD close the connection if that is necessary to prevent the
> client from continuing the request.
>
> If the client manages to read the 413 response, it MUST honor it and
> SHOULD reflect it to the user.
>
> If this restriction is considered temporary, the server MAY include a
> Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what
> time the client MAY try again.
