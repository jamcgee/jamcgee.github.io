> ## 6.5.11.  413 Payload Too Large
>
> The 413 (Payload Too Large) status code indicates that the server is
> refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger
> than the server is willing or able to process.  The server MAY close
> the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.
>
> If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a
> Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after
> what time the client MAY try again.
