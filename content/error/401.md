> ## 3.1.  401 Unauthorized
>
> The 401 (Unauthorized) status code indicates that the request has not
> been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for
> the target resource.  The server generating a 401 response MUST send
> a WWW-Authenticate header field
> ([Section 4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-4.1))
> containing at least one
> challenge applicable to the target resource.
>
> If the request included authentication credentials, then the 401
> response indicates that authorization has been refused for those
> credentials.  The user agent MAY repeat the request with a new or
> replaced Authorization header field
> ([Section 4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-4.2)).
> If the 401
> response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the
> user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then
> the user agent SHOULD present the enclosed representation to the
> user, since it usually contains relevant diagnostic information.
