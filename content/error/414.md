> ## 6.5.12.  414 URI Too Long
>
> The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is
> refusing to service the request because the request-target
> ([Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3))
> is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
> This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has
> improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long query
> information, when the client has descended into a "black hole" of
> redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of
> itself) or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to
> exploit potential security holes.
>
> A 414 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
> indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
> [Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2)).
