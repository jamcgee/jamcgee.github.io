> ## 4.2.  412 Precondition Failed
>
> The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more
> conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when
> tested on the server.  This response code allows the client to place
> preconditions on the current resource state (its current
> representations and metadata) and, thus, prevent the request method
> from being applied if the target resource is in an unexpected state.

> ## 412 Unless True
>
> The condition given in the Unless request-header field
> (Section 10.40) evaluated to true when it was tested on the server
> and the request did not include a Range header field (which would
> indicate a partial GET) or an If-Modified-Since header field (which
> would indicate a conditional GET). This response code allows the
> client to place arbitrary preconditions on the current resource
> metainformation (header field data) and thus prevent the requested
> method from being applied to a resource other than the one intended.
