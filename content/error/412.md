> ## 4.2.  412 Precondition Failed
>
> The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more
> conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when
> tested on the server.  This response code allows the client to place
> preconditions on the current resource state (its current
> representations and metadata) and, thus, prevent the request method
> from being applied if the target resource is in an unexpected state.
