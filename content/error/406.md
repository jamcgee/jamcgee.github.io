> ## 6.5.6.  406 Not Acceptable
>
> The 406 (Not Acceptable) status code indicates that the target
> resource does not have a current representation that would be
> acceptable to the user agent, according to the proactive negotiation
> header fields received in the request (Section 5.3), and the server
> is unwilling to supply a default representation.
>
> The server SHOULD generate a payload containing a list of available
> representation characteristics and corresponding resource identifiers
> from which the user or user agent can choose the one most
> appropriate.  A user agent MAY automatically select the most
> appropriate choice from that list.  However, this specification does
> not define any standard for such automatic selection, as described in
> [Section 6.4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.1).
