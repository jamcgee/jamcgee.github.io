> ## 6.5.10.  411 Length Required
>
> The 411 (Length Required) status code indicates that the server
> refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length
> ([Section 3.3.2 of [RFC7230]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2)).
> The client MAY repeat the request if
> it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of
> the message body in the request message.

> ## 411 Authorization Refused
>
> The request credentials provided by the client were rejected by the
> server or insufficient to grant authorization to access the
> resource. This is similar to the 403 (forbidden) response, but
> allows more information to be provided to the user. The content of
> the response should contain a description of the problem and may
> suggest corrective action. HTTP access authentication is explained
> in [Section 10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-01#section-10).
>
> The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field
> ([Section 8.30](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-01#section-8.30))
> containing a challenge applicable to the requested
> resource. If the challenge is different from that assumed by the
> last request, the client may repeat the request with a suitable
> Authorization header field after obtaining the user's approval.
