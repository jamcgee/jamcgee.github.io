      Circuit design, <abbr title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</abbr> layout, firmware development, and integrated testing for flight systems.
      Systems centered around use of the ARM [Cortex-M](https://developer.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m).
      Limited work investigating use of the [Cortex-R](https://developer.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-r) (including initial CPU bring-up) and <abbr title="Field Programmable Gate Arrays">FPGAs</abbr>.
      General focus on sensor systems.

      Interfaced with Enterprise PLM Systems, Component Manufacturers, Prototyping Vendors, and Contract Manufacturers.
      Implemented and administered database for the centralized management of component libraries for Altium and Orcad/Allegro.

      Considerable independence was demonstrated through all phases of project lifetime: research, design, and implementation.
      Regularly handled communication with customers, leadership, and vendors.

      Developed Linux-based C++ software for signal processing applications.
      Made extensive use of [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) for parallelization and [Asio](http://think-async.com/) for asynchronous network I/O.
      Designed algorithms based on Bayesian inference for purposes of pattern identification and estimation.

      Programmed stand-alone and PC-based Xilinx FPGA systems for signal processing applications.
      Development focused on implementing Ethernet (1G and 10G) and UDP/IP for data exchange, fixed-point and floating-point pipelined computations.

      Designed, built, and programmed embedded radio systems based on the [Texas Instruments MSP430](https://www.ti.com/microcontrollers/msp430-ultra-low-power-mcus/overview.html) and [Chipcon radios](http://www.ti.com/product/cc1101).
      Emphasis was on physical miniaturization and minimizing power consumption.
      Software development was bare-metal in C++, supported by limited use of assembly to construct a rudimentary threaded Real Time Operating System (RTOS).
      Prototypes have operated autonomously in the field for multiple years without need of servicing.
