title: Ethernet
---

Much of my recent professional development has focused on Ethernet, making it a convenient target for technical essays.
Unlike much of the Internet, this series of essays will focus on practical implementation of Ethernet from an FPGA or ASIC perspective.
This means the necessary waveforms and encodings to generate ethernet packets when directly connected to a PHY or medium.

The essays will be making extensive references to IEEE 802.3-2022 and every effort will be made to specify the exact clauses for further research by the reader.
I will not be using the amendment names (e.g. 802.3z for Gigabit Ethernet) because they are not not useful for finding content within the actual standard and any given clause may have been modified by multiple amendments.
